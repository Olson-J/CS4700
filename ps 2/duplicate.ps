% args: duplication value
% description: this operator will search the stack for the given 
%   duplication value, and if found each occurence of the value 
%   will be duplicated.
%   If the value is not present in the stack, the stack becomes 
%   empty. If not given a duplication value/the stack is empty, 
%   the stack will remain empty.
% examples:
%   1 2 2 3 2 duplicate is called
%   stack is now 1 2 2 2 2 3
%   
%   33 duplicate is called
%   stack is still empty
